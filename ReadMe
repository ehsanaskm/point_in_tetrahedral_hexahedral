The txt files are explained as follws:


1- The nvnf_hexa (number of vertices, number of faces, number of vertices in each face) for Hexahedral 
2- The nvnf_tetra (number of vertices, number of faces, number of vertices in each face) for Tetrahedral 

3- vertex_hexa: coordinates per vertex (Hexahedral)
4- face_hex: indices of vertices (Hexahedral)

5- vertex_tetra: coordinates per vertex (Tetrahedral)
6- face_tetra: indices of vertices (Tetrahedral)
